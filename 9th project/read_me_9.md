Project description

You work for a startup that sells food. You need to understand how the users of your mobile app behave.

Study the sales funnel. Find out how users get to the point of purchase. How many users reach the purchase, and how many - "stuck" in the previous steps? Which ones exactly?

After that, examine the results of the A/A / B experiment. The designers wanted to change the fonts in the entire application, and the managers were afraid that users would be unfamiliar. We agreed to make a decision based on the results of the A/A/B test. Users were divided into 3 groups: 2 control groups with old fonts and one experimental group with new ones. Find out which font is better.

Creating two A groups instead of one has certain advantages. If the two control groups are equal, you can be sure of the accuracy of the test. If there are significant differences between the values of A and A, this will help to detect the factors that led to the distortion of the results. Comparing the control groups also helps you understand how much time and data will be required for further tests.

In the case of general analytics and an A/A/B experiment, work with the same data. In real projects, there are always experiments. Analysts examine the quality of the application based on general data, without taking into account the users ' affiliation to the experiments.
