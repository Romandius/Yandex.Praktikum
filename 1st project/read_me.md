This project is aimed at developing data processing skills and preparing them for further analysis.

Project description

The customer is the bank's credit department. It is necessary to understand whether the marital status and the number of children of the client affect the fact of repayment of the loan on time. Input data from the bank — statistics on the solvency of customers.

The results of the study will be taken into account when building a credit scoring model — a special system that evaluates the ability of a potential borrower to repay a loan to a bank.
