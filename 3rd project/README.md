Project description

You are an analyst at Megaline, a federal mobile operator. Customers are offered two tariff plans: "Smart" and "Ultra". To adjust the advertising budget, the commercial department wants to understand which tariff brings in more money.

You will have to make a preliminary analysis of the tariffs on a small sample of customers. You have at your disposal the data of 500 users of Megalain»: who they are, where they come from, what tariff they use, how many calls and messages each sent in 2018. You need to analyze the behavior of customers and make a conclusion — which tariff is better.
